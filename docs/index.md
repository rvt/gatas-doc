The GA/TAS Conspicuity device is designed for General Aviation pilots flying in areas where multiple protocols, such as OGN, Flarm, ADS-L, and FANET, are used. It can transmit and receive multiple protocols simultaneously (excluding sending ADS-B) using one or more transceiver modules. All received traffic is sent to your Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), such as SkyDemon, via the GLD90 protocol.

The device is built around the Raspberry Pi Pico 2040 and can be configured with a custom PCB that supports either two transceivers or a simpler configuration with one. In both setups, it can send and receive all protocols using time-sharing technology. The device can store configurations for multiple aircraft, which can be selected through an easy-to-use web interface.

Powered by a Li-Ion battery, the device includes a PCB with a USB-C charger. The estimated battery life is between 4 and 6 hours, though this is subject to further testing.
